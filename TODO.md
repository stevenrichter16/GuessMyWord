# TODO

- Restart confirmation in dark mode should use a purple accent.
- Remove tabs; move the sidebar ellipses toggle to the bottom of the screen. The sidebar should open as a menu that slides up from the bottom instead of sliding out from the side.
- Add Replay feature (new page):
  - Show an “All Animals” circle first.
  - Present the first question with non-tappable Yes/No buttons.
  - Animate the tapped answer button (expand briefly).
  - New top-candidate animal avatars emerge from the All Animals circle and hover gently.
  - Present the next question and Yes/No buttons; animate the chosen answer.
  - If prior top candidates drop out, their avatars get pulled back into the All Animals circle; new top candidates emerge.
  - Repeat for all questions; each question segment lasts ~3 seconds from appearance to candidate updates.
