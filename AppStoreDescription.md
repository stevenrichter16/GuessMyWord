# 20 Questions: Animal Edition — App Store Description

Meet Larry the Llama, your chatty guide through a fast, friendly round of 20 Questions. Think of an animal from our menagerie of 100 creatures and tap through playful yes/no answers while Larry tries to outsmart you.

## Why you’ll love it

- **Delightful finishes.** Celebrate a correct guess with satisfying confetti and a cheeky victory message.
- **On-device smarts.** A custom 20 Questions model filters your answers to narrow down the right animal, even when you’re offline.
