# App Store Description

Think of any animal and watch a tiny on-device sleuth try to guess it in ten taps or less. **20 Questions: Animal Edition** combines classic guess-the-animal vibes with a playful llama host, quick-fire yes/no/maybe prompts, and a confident final guess complete with a one-line rationale.

## Why you'll love it
- **Speedy rounds.** The game automatically starts asking the first question and keeps the pace snappy with one concise prompt per turn.
- **LLM brains, offline heart.** A carefully guided on-device model sticks to short, sensible questions and can even play offline using a built-in animal dataset.
- **Hint-friendly.** Share a mid-game hint when you're feeling generous—the sleuth works it into the next question.
- **No dead ends.** If the model ever stumbles, it falls back to canned questions or a Core ML guess so every round finishes with a confident pick.
- **Feel the flair.** Celebrate wins with confetti, a friendly llama mascot, and a colorful menagerie of animal icons.

## How to play
1. Think of any common animal in the app's menagerie.
2. Answer Yes/No/Maybe/Not sure as the llama fires off up to 10 questions.
3. Read the final guess and rationale, then tap Correct or Incorrect—restart anytime for a fresh round.

Whether you're killing time in line or challenging friends, **20 Questions: Animal Edition** keeps the smiles coming with quick rounds, cozy vibes, and a surprisingly clever llama detective.
